    "# Preliminary Thesis – Problem and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Supervised malware detection models for Docker containers rely on labeled malware families.\n",
    "In real-world scenarios, malware labels are often unavailable, incomplete, or outdated,\n",
    "making such approaches ineffective against zero-day attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Existing image-based container malware detection methods assume access to known malware\n",
    "samples during training. This assumption does not hold in practical deployments where\n",
    "novel or obfuscated malware appears continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Approach\n",
    "This work explores a self-supervised anomaly detection framework for Docker containers.\n",
    "The model is trained exclusively on benign container images to learn the normal structure\n",
    "of container filesystems. Containers that deviate from this learned representation are\n",
    "flagged as suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Pipeline\n",
    "Docker Image → Filesystem Tarball → Byte-to-Image Representation → \n",
    "Self-Supervised Model → Anomaly Score\n"
